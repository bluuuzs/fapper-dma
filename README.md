# Fapper-DMA


### Pretty much in testing right now, however it will function. The web menu, aimbot, triggerbot, ESP, ETC will function as normal


## Added a web menu, turned out way better than i expected. Can edit most settings, you can create, load, save, delete configs from the web menu, the web menu does not use localhost so it can be ran on a device connected to your internet.



### Quick and easy guide:
