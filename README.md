### Installer Guide:

Download the installer from the github [releases](https://github.com/bluuuzs/veltrix-dma/releases/tag/Installer)
Run the installer on your radar PC.
The installer will automatically grab the DLL's and exe from this github and create a folder in your Downloads and place them there.
Once done, run fapperdma.exe, and wait for it to load

This installer only takes 10 seconds and does not require going on the github, you can just keep this Installer inside of the folder the installer created and run it whenever there is an update.



### Manual Download Guide:

Download all of the DLL's and the exe from the github
Extract them sonewhere on your Radar PC
Ensure that the DLL's and exe are in the same folder before running
Run veltrix.exe, and wait for it to load.


### Notes:

The webmenu HTML file hasn't been added to the cheat's directory, i made the webmenu to support a different code and uzi has to make it support his. we're prioritizing other features rather than the webmenu. You can preview what it will look like at https://veltrixsolutions.xyz/preview, this is mainly what it will look like but will have alot more features as i made this webmenu for a fortnite dma cheat with less features


We have swapped over to a different source, this source features most of what the old source had with more such as: Prediction, Head ESP, Loot ESP (In development), and more.
Im pretty sure the webmenu is broken right now, html not found error, will be fixed today/tomorrow.
I lost my un-obfuscated webmenu HTML source, i cannot make updates to the webmenu unless i make a new one.
