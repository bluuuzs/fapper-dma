### Installer Guide:

Download the installer from the github [releases](https://github.com/bluuuzs/fapper-dma/releases/tag/Installer)
Run the installer on your radar PC.
The installer will automatically grab the DLL's and exe from this github and create a folder in your Downloads and place them there.
Once done, run fapperdma.exe, and wait for it to load

This installer only takes 10 seconds and does not require going on the github, you can just keep this Installer inside of the folder the installer created and run it whenever there is an update.

### Notes:

We have swapped over to a different source, this source features most of what the old source had with more such as: Prediction, Head ESP, Loot ESP (In development), and more.
Im pretty sure the webmenu is broken right now, html not found error, will be fixed today/tomorrow.
I lost my un-obfuscated webmenu HTML source, i cannot make updates to the webmenu unless i make a new one.
You can view most of our features here: https://fapper-dma.web.app/#features
